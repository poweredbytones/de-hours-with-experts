# My submission for the code challenge
I went the python route. Thanks for checking it out. :)

## Important
I just found out there were tests, and I ran pytest... There were quite a few failures... 
It being so late on the 1st I will submit and take a look at the code in the morning. If I am not immediately disqualified I'd like to submit again.
Deadlines are important, but I failed to reach this one.
