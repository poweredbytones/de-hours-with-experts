# My submission for the code challenge
I went the python route. Thanks for checking it out. :)

## Updated on morning of 3/2
I found the silly little bug and now all tests pass. I acknoledge I fixed it after the deadline, but I couldn't just leave it broken and I couldn't remain at PC last night.
Also... sometimes you need to walk away before you can see the 'obvious' problem.

## Important
I just found out there were tests, and I ran pytest... There were quite a few failures... 
It being so late on the 1st I will submit and take a look at the code in the morning. If I am not immediately disqualified I'd like to submit again.
Deadlines are important, but I failed to reach this one.
